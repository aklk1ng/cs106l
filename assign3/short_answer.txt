Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. const-correctness is if we don't need modify entire object, we should use the const to mark an entire object read-only.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Yes, i check each method and confirm whether they need to change the object, if not, i will add the const interface.
